# Pinky

Experimental. Goal: Interactively derive biological facts using an inference engine.

There are three (intended) main components:

- `ui` - a React-based user interface [TODO]
- `api` - a GraphQL API that uses the Clara inference engine [WIP]
- `pipeline` - a pipeline for preparing the built-in data [TODO]
